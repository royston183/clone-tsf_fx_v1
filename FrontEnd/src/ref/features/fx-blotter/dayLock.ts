 * The program's rules, as pure functions below:
 *   - LOCK is refused while any transaction is still Created (TXN_STATUS 01), i.e. not yet released to MO;
 *   - LOCK is refused while a row has been started but not created (no RFHA but a partner, profit centre,
 *     business area or transaction type entered);
 *   - a blotter whose own day is locked is read-only;
 *   - a blotter whose previous working day is not locked is read-only too.
